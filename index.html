                                Welcome to my page, entirely programmed and written by me. Pretty cool huh?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I'm a young programmer within the United States.

                                I mainly just want to learn. Knowing how to do stuff just for convenience (or to show off) can really be helpful, especially when coding.

                                Eventually, I wish to get into my dream college, being MIT. It'll be reallllyyyy hard to do so, and I would like to be real with myself, I doubt I'll be able to make it in. But I'll sure as hell try.

                                I really want to get into AI and the logistics of how it even works, and I'm planning on inserting AI into my work to help boost the efficiency of my work even further.
                                <br>
                                I also really want to start learning node.js, as I have seen it used for many applications.

                                I mainly work on Python-based projects, but sometimes I like to mess around with other programming languages.

                                I'm currently creating games using the Lua based engine <a href="https://www.roblox.com/" style="color:darkblue;">Roblox</a>. (Most of these games are still WIP, if you would like to see some of these games, press the link <a href="projects" style="color:darkblue;">here</a>!)
                                <br>
                                I also just mess around with different things like animation, 3D design (not very good at that one), but I am mainly learning how to animate.

                                This website! I honestly have no idea how HTML, CSS, or JS or Java even works! So this is all completely new to me.
