        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a young programming addict who always wants to create new things.
        </p>
        <h2>What I am currently working on & my goals</h2>
        <p>
            I'm currently working on Python-based projects. Most of these projects are scary, to say the least. Some of these projects can really harm individuals and even groups of people.
            I am learning how these harmful software or viruses work to create repellents against them. However, these ways of fighting against viruses and other malicious code become outdated.
            This is where I try and help, I create harmful code that can really mess things up. I do this by looking at multiple sources that have this type of code, figuring out what makes them hard to detect and harmful, and then combining them.
            With this, I actively look out for more ways how to make the code more harmful and undetectable, and with that, I simply make my findings public.
            Never will I make the code that has the ability to harm people public, as I will not risk what destruction the program can bring.
            <br>
            I really want to get into AI and the logistics of how it even works, and I'm planning on inserting AI into my work to help boost the efficiency of my findings even further.
