                <h1>Roblox Game Developing Vulnerabilities</h1>
                <br>
                <p>There are hundreds of ways that your Roblox game can become vulnerable to an attack. This can come from a variety of different ways.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Third Party Attacks (DDOS)</h2>
                <a name="third_party_attacks"> </a>
                <p>When a Third Party Attack begins on your game, this can range from anything to a DDOS, it can mess up your game to the point where nobody can play it. You can open yourself up to these attacks by enabling HTTP requests from and to your game. This is done by accessing the game settings as a developer.</p>

                    These Third Party Attacks are usually a DDOS. To understand what DDOS is, we have to break it down. DOS in DDOS stands for Denial of Service. <br>
                    This is an attack done by one person to bring a specific server down, and because Roblox uses servers for players, it can be vulnerable to these attacks. <br>
                    To understand how this attack even works, we need to know how a server works. <br>
                    A server, in simple terms, is a big digital storage that programs can use for a purpose, but this storage is not infinte. <br>
                    There is a maxium of what these servers can handle, and a DOS attack takes advantage of this. A DOS attack sends as much storage to the server as possible to fill it up, which causes the server to have no more room for anything, and if you continue to fill up the server while it already is full, the server will shut down. <br>
                    A DDOS stands for Distrubted Denial of Service, this attack means it does done by mutliple people or one person with multiple devices. <br>
                    This is basically a DOS attack but a LOT more powerful. Which means it is easier to make servers shut down. <br>
                    <br>
                    Again, the only way to make your game vulnerable to this attack is by enabling HTTP requests for your game. <br>
                    Though sometimes, your game needs these HTTP requests, so here are some ways to defend against these attacks. <br>
                    <br>
                    The only way a DDOS or DOS attack can even happen, is if they have the server IP, which is the location of the server. <br> 
                    Think of it this way, I want to send a bunch of trash to my enemy's house, but I don't know where his location is, so there is no way I can send my trash to my enemy. <br> 
                    But if I did infact have my enemy's location, I can easily send that trash to him. In this case, the IP of the server is the location of my enemy's house, and the trash is the DOS or DDOS attacks. <br>
                    And the only way people can get this IP, is by going into the server. Which means if you can ban the player or players that are doing this attack from your game, you can essentially stop the attack. <br>
                    Though there is a flaw to this as you need to ban them before they ever join the game. <br>
                    A better solution to this problem would be to use this <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/your-roblox-game-servers-are-being-ddosed-i-made-a-solution/2331576" style="color:darkblue;" target="_blank">tool</a>, made by <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/u/forbrad" style="color:darkblue;" target="_blank">forbrad</a> on Roblox.
