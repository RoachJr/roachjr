                <p>There are hundreds of ways that your Roblox game can become vulnerable to an attack. This can come from a variety of different ways.</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Third Party Attacks (DDOS)</h2>
                <p>When a Third Party Attack begins on your game, this can range from anything to a DDOS, it can mess up your game to the point where nobody can play it. You can open yourself up to these attacks by enabling HTTP requests from and to your game. This is done by accessing the game settings as a developer.</p>
